    <p>
      A light and gently sweet breakfast dish or a dessert for picky eaters.
      With crispy coating and the light and soft inside, you get a lovely
      balance of flavors and textures.These delicious pancakes pair perfectly
      with sour cream and fruit in pretty much any form.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      The right choice of cheese is extremely important for this dish. Farmer's
      cheese will suit best. Another alternative is using ricotta or cottage
      cheese. In this case, the taste and flavor will be slightly different.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cups farmer's cheese, homemade</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus about 1/2 cup more for dredging</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>half teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2-3 tablespoons extra light olive oil for each batch</li>
      <li>fresh fruit, jam, or sour cream for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
      Before frying, make sure the oil in the skillet is hot. Test it by
      sprinkling a bit of flour into the pan. If it sizzles, the temperature is
      right.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Beat eggs, salt and sugar together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Add flour and farmer's cheese. Mix well until the dough is thick and
        sticky.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, add 2-3 tablespoon oil.</li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into portions, form into balls and coat with some flour.
        With well-floured hands, flatten slightly to form into discs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is hot, place the discs and fry until golden brown, 3-5
        minutes each side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with your favorite toppings - jam, sour cream, or fruits and
        berries.
      </li>
    </ol>
